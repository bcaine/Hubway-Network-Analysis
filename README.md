# Hubway Bike Network Analysis

This Ipython Notebook has most of the Network Analysis done for my final project for [Complex Networks and Applications](http://barabasilab.neu.edu/courses/phys5116/), a Graduate Physics course on Network Science at Northeastern University. It's taught by [Albert-László Barabási](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si), who is probably happy that he is getting another link on the internet...

The data used in this analysis can be found from the [Hubway Data Visualization Challenge](http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/). To run this analysis, simply download the zip file and put the hubway_stations.csv and hubway_trips.csv files in the data/ directory.
